<!-- <h3 class="mt-30 c-white">How does Lightning Auth work?</h3>
<p class="c-gray-1">Lightning Auth uses your unique Lightning Node Public Key as your login.</p>
<p class="c-gray-1">You authenticate by providing a Lightning Payment Request which is used to validate that you have access to your Lightning Node.</p>

<h3 class="mt-30 c-white">Do I need a Lightning Node to login?</h3>
<p class="c-gray-1">If you're not running your own Lightning Node or using a non-custodial Lightning wallet, you won't be able to use Lightning Auth.</p>
<p class="c-gray-1">Altenatively, you can log in with Twitter.</p> -->
